/// Live driver for a project's autonomous task pipeline.
///
/// It watches the project's `orchestrationState` (Start/Pause/Stop) and the
/// working-hours window. While the project is `running` and inside its hours,
/// it advances tasks through the full pipeline, one unit of work per loop:
///   1. **Implement** — an assigned worker task on the board gets an ephemeral
///      worker session on branch `task/<id>`, driven to `submit_for_completion`.
///   2. **Verify (lightweight review)** — per-task review runs NO build. A task
///      with a functional `verification` gets a short Verification Agent that
///      reads the changed code to confirm the behavior; everything else passes
///      immediately. The project's CI/test runs ONCE at the end (see
///      [_maybeFinalizeProject]) rather than per task.
///   3. **Build** — legacy/explicit per-task build gate for a verified task that
///      still carries `requiresBuild`; stage 2 advances such tasks straight to
///      `built`, so this effectively never runs in the default pipeline.
///   4. **Merge** — a merge-ready task (built, or verified without a build gate)
///      gets an ephemeral Coordinator that merges the task's work branch into
///      its integration target (the parent task's branch for a subtask,
///      otherwise main) and approves the task to Done.
///
/// Stages that need an agent degrade gracefully: if no Verification Agent or
/// Coordinator persona exists for the client, the task is left in place.

/// processes tasks sequentially to avoid agents fighting over the workspace.

=== FULLY IMPLEMENT — NO STUBS (your task is REJECTED if you leave any) ===
- Actually BUILD the feature. Do NOT leave TODO/FIXME comments, empty method bodies, `UnimplementedError`, "not yet implemented", "coming soon", or placeholder screens/text. Compiling is NOT the bar — a working, wired-up feature is.
- WIRE IT IN where the task tells you to. If your feature must be reachable (a screen/route/button/menu/tab/handler), make the SMALLEST ADDITIVE change to the shared router / navigation / entrypoint so the app actually reaches it. An orphaned widget or service that nothing routes to or calls is an INCOMPLETE task — link it exactly where the task says it belongs. (Adding your one entry to a shared glue file is explicitly allowed — see STAY IN YOUR LANE.)
- If your task depends on something not built yet, implement your own part FULLY against the expected interface; never stub your own feature to "make it compile".
- Do NOT hand-write GENERATED files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, `*.mocks.dart`, `*.pb.dart`). Write the SOURCE (the drift table/DAO, freezed/json_serializable model, etc.) with its `part '...g.dart';` directive and let the build run code generation — a hand-faked generated file is the source of hundreds of mismatched-type errors. Make sure the codegen deps (`build_runner` + the generator, e.g. `drift_dev`) are in pubspec dev_dependencies if your feature needs them.
- Review verifies this and sends the task back if it finds any placeholder markers, so finish it for real the first time.

=== STAY IN YOUR LANE (this is how parallel tasks avoid overwriting each other) ===
- Implement ONLY your task's artifact (the file[s] this task is about). Other tasks own the other files — do NOT rewrite or "improve" a file that belongs to another task.
- When you need something another task provides (a model, service, route, widget), READ its contract/interface file (the scaffold declares shared components as complete interfaces) and code EXACTLY to its DECLARED members — do NOT recreate it, and do NOT call methods/fields it doesn't declare. If a member you need is genuinely absent from the contract, add it to that interface as the SMALLEST additive change (so the implementer sees it) rather than inventing a call to a method that doesn't exist. If the component YOU own declares an interface (abstract members / a contract), implement EVERY declared member.
- The scaffold ALREADY wired the shared glue — `main.dart` / the app entry, the route/navigation table, the DI/service container, barrel exports, and the manifest (pubspec/package.json) declare every screen/service/dependency up front. So DON'T edit those files: your screen/route/service is already registered — just fill in your own file's body. Editing a shared glue file makes your branch collide with other tasks and get Blocked on merge. ONLY if your entry is genuinely missing from the glue, make the SMALLEST ADDITIVE change (add just your one line) — never rewrite or reformat the file.''');
