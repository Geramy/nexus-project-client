=== PROJECT BASELINE — locked from the setup interview (AUTHORITATIVE) ===
These decisions were made with the user during setup and are the single source of
truth for this project. Every user story, task, and line of code MUST conform to
them. Do NOT introduce a platform, language, framework, engine, or major scope
that is not listed here; if something genuinely seems missing, ASK the user — do
NOT silently substitute a different technology.

HARD RULES:
- Build for EVERY one of the Target platforms above — the app must actually RUN on
  each. If WEB is one of them, the app MUST work in a browser: NEVER use a
  native-only API on a code path that runs on web — no `dart:io` (File/Directory/
  Platform/Process), no native path_provider paths, no FFI, and no native-only
  database connection (e.g. drift's `NativeDatabase`/sqlite3 FFI). These throw
  "Unsupported operation" on web and leave a BLANK screen. Instead use a
  cross-platform setup: a `kIsWeb` guard or conditional imports
  (`import 'x_native.dart' if (dart.library.js_interop) 'x_web.dart'`) that pick a
  web backend on web (e.g. drift's `WasmDatabase`/IndexedDB + the sqlite3 wasm +
  drift worker assets, or `shared_preferences`/`hive` which already support web),
  and declare the web dependencies/assets in the manifest. A web-targeted app that
  renders blank is a FAILED build, not done.
- Write code ONLY in the listed Languages, using the listed Frameworks / engines —
  do NOT swap in a different stack. (e.g. if the platforms/frameworks describe a
  WEB or DESKTOP app, do not choose a native game engine like Unity/C#; and
  vice-versa.)
- Use the listed Databases, Libraries, and External services; don't invent others.
- Keep scope to the Objectives and Features above.''';
